# React Todo List Application

This React Todo List Application allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. It features the ability to add, delete, and filter tasks based on their status (all, pending, completed). Additionally, the app supports dark and light themes, making it accessible and visually comfortable for users at any time of the day.

## Features

- **Add Todo**: Users can add new tasks to their todo list.
- **Delete Todo**: Users can remove tasks they no longer need to track.
- **Filter Todos**: Tasks can be filtered to show all, only pending, or only completed tasks.
- **Persistent Storage**: Todo items are saved in `localStorage`, ensuring that tasks persist across browser sessions.
- **Theme Toggling**: Users can switch between light and dark themes according to their preference. Your theme preference is saved automatically and will be applied the next time you visit.
